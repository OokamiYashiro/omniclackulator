            <h2>About the OmniClackulator</h2>
            <p>Forged in the digital embers of a forgotten Tuesday and powered by lukewarm coffee and existential ennui, the OmniClackulatorâ„¢ is not your average purveyor of prognostication. It does not offer comforting horoscopes, nor does it dispense easily digestible life advice. Instead, it serves as a slightly tarnished mirror reflecting the beautifully absurd, often disappointing, yet undeniably amusing tapestry of your inner turmoil.</p>
            <p>We specialize in handcrafted sarcasm, bespoke bewilderment, and diagnoses that are as unhelpful as they are (hopefully) entertaining. If you came seeking genuine guidance, you've made a wonderfully ironic navigational error. If you came to have your darkest, quirkiest suspicions about yourself validated by a disembodied digital voice with a penchant for melodrama, then welcome. You're in precisely the wrong, yet somehow perfect, place.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Methodology (Or Lack Thereof)</h2>
            <p>The OmniClackulator's patented "Abbreviated Assessment of Inherent Grimness" utilizes a highly advanced, proprietary algorithm involving quantum entanglement with particularly cynical squirrels, the resonant frequencies of slightly burnt toast, and the collective sigh of everyone who has ever had to attend a mandatory team-building exercise. </p>
            <p>Your responses are cross-referenced with our vast archives of human folly and questionable life choices. The resulting "archetype" is less a scientific classification and more a lovingly crafted caricature. Accuracy is not guaranteed, but a vague sense of being "seen" (and gently mocked) is highly probable. Do not attempt to replicate our methods; it mostly involves a lot of staring into the middle distance and questioning the nature of reality.</p>
