        <h1>Privacy Policy for The OmniClackulator</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></em></p>

        <p>Welcome to The OmniClackulator (hereinafter referred to as "the Site"). This Site is provided for entertainment purposes only. We are committed to respecting your privacy, or at least, not actively trying to complicate it further.</p>

        <h2>Information We Don't Collect (Because We Can't Be Bothered)</h2>
        <p>The OmniClackulator is a simple, client-side application. This means all quiz processing happens directly in your web browser. We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or IP address directly through the quiz.</li>
            <li>Store your quiz answers on any server. Your delightful patterns of despair are your own to cherish locally.</li>
            <li>Use cookies for tracking your activity across the Site for our own purposes (the quiz is self-contained).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Collected by Third Parties (Google AdSense)</h2>
        <p>To support the Site and its ongoing mission to mildly amuse, we may display advertisements from Google AdSense. Google AdSense is an advertising service provided by Google LLC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google AdSense may use cookies (such as the DoubleClick DART cookie) to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website or other websites on the internet.</li>
            <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
            <li>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ads Settings</a>.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For further information regarding Google's privacy practices, please review Google's Privacy & Terms: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect your personal data directly, your main choices regarding privacy relate to the third-party advertising cookies from Google AdSense, as detailed above.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time if the OmniClackulator ever develops ambitions beyond its current station. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page, probably during a moment of profound existential boredom.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us (Hypothetically)</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you'd like to debate the merits of lukewarm coffee, you can't really contact us because we're a figment of a digital imagination. But thanks for playing along.</p>
