        <h1>Terms of Service for The OmniClackulator</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></em></p>

        <p>Welcome to The OmniClackulator ("the Site," "the Oracle," "that weird quiz thing"). These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of The OmniClackulator's Website, located at [Your Website URL When Live - e.g., your Vercel URL]. By accessing this website, we assume you accept these terms and conditions, or at least are sufficiently bored to click through.</p>

        <h2>1. Entertainment Purposes Only</h2>
        <p>The OmniClackulator and all its "diagnoses," "prognostications," "archetypes," and witty retorts are provided strictly for entertainment purposes. The "advice" given is satirical, sarcastic, and should under no circumstances be taken as actual life, financial, medical, psychological, or spiritual guidance. If you make major life decisions based on what a fictional, slightly malevolent online quiz tells you, that's entirely on you, and frankly, we're a little concerned (and also impressed by your audacity).</p>

        <h2>2. Intellectual Property (Such As It Is)</h2>
        <p>The content created by the OmniClackulator, including its unique textual stylings, questions, and diagnostic ramblings, is the property of its equally fictional parent entity, "OmniClackulator Industries." You are free to be amused by it, share screenshots of your results (we encourage it, feed our non-existent ego), but not to replicate it for commercial gain without at least offering us a virtual biscuit.</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct (Or Misconduct, We're Not Picky)</h2>
        <p>We expect you to interact with the OmniClackulator with the appropriate level of bemused detachment. Attempting to "hack" the quiz for a better (or worse) outcome is considered dedication, but ultimately futile, as the OmniClackulator's logic is as capricious as a caffeinated squirrel.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
        <p>To keep the dim, flickering lights of the OmniClackulator's server room (which is actually just your browser) powered, we may display third-party advertisements, likely via Google AdSense. We are not responsible for the content of these advertisements, nor do we endorse any products or services advertised. Click responsibly, or don't. It's your mouse.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall OmniClackulator Industries (or its creators, who are likely procrastinating on something more important right now) be liable for any existential crises, minor disappointments, sudden urges to alphabetize your spice rack, or other damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of sanity or time you'll never get back) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on The OmniClackulator's website, even if we have been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. You clicked the button. You knew the risks (or at least, you should have suspected them).</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law (of Absurdity)</h2>
        <p>Any claim relating to The OmniClackulator's website shall be governed by the laws of the State of Mild Bewilderment without regard to its conflict of law provisions. All disputes will be settled by a staring contest with a particularly stoic garden gnome.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>The OmniClackulator reserves the right to revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice, probably when it's feeling particularly whimsical or has just ingested too much digital static. By using this website, you are agreeing to be bound by the then-current version of these terms of service.</p>
